Innovations in product offerings, like functional waters and nutritional drinks that promote hydration and overall well-being, are fueling consumer interest. The demand for beverages tailored to specific health needs – such as probiotics and supplements – further complements this trend. </p> <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> </p> <p> Furthermore, the online retail channel has demonstrated significant growth in the distribution of pet beverages, allowing easy access to a wider range of products.
